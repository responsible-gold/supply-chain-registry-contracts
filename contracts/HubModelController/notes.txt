/* TODO:

Hub
- Updatable relay factory

ModelRelay:
+ read ABI, is something's conflicting about implementation?
+ in-call parameter for variable "output length" through assembly, compare gas costs with regular approach.
- modifier onlyHubOrController
- setMethod output size
- ? optional public params of methods sizes

Controller:
- set output sizes



Questions:
- Can prepanding with 0s of msg.data be used to interfere or hack? We assume that we only call solidity contracts
- Can we make Relay logic switchable while preserving data? Still having minimum gas costs.


Later:
- work on upgradable delegatecall mechanism
- identifying if delegate contract has destruct call
- statically check if ModelFactory works staticcall(g, a, in, insize, out, outsize)
